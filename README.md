# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns Examples in C Sharp

## Strategy Pattern
*Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.*

## Observer Pattern
*Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.*
